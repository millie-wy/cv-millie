# Millie Cheung's CV (2nd version)

A new version of my digital CV, which is a full stack MERN application. Compared to the previous version I built when I started learning programming, this upgraded version has been redesigned for a better UX, and is written in more advanced JavaScript. I have also made use of the JS library React and component libraries such as MUI and Formik, with many npm packages. On this webpage, visitors can preview all my published projects retrieved directly from MongoDB and even send me an email via the contact form.

This project was built with ReactJS, MUI and Formik in the frontend, and Express, NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, Multer and Nodemailer in the backend.
